This is a learning management system where lessons can be created, updated and deleted by the teacher. Users are assigned different responsibilities in that what a teacher can do is different from what a student can.
We also have the curriculum where you can get the lessons and be able to learn different chapters.
To start learning you have to be a registered student and log in to the website. Teacher responsibility can only be assigned by the admin of the website
